### Public sheet  
Anyone with a Bitcoin address or a FLO blockchain address can make entries to the sheet  

### Private sheet  
Only authorized Bitcoin or FLO addresses can make entries  

### Creation of a sheet  
• Currently this feature is kept to only authorized sub-admins of the RanchiMall ecosystem to avoid flooding of data and to maintain the quality of data  
• Sub-admins are approved FLO or BTC addresses that can make changes such as the creation of a sheet and scoring the entries inside a sheet  

### Scoring  
• Scoring is done to maintain the authenticity of the data  
• Unscored entries or entries with a score of 0 are automatically deleted from the cloud after 7 days  
• Scoring can only be done by the authorized FLO or BTC addresses 

#### Note:  
• Currently Flo LogSheet has sheets for various RanchiMall projects like Project B (Token Room) El Salvador, BIT Sindri Blockchain Project, blockchain-based Labour Market in Ranchi, and the token allocation & room nights data for Token Room  
• RanchiMall uses these sheets to maintain the quality and accuracy of these project's statistics
